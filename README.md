Polygon Stadium if an arena based first person shooter, where players progress through rounds of increasing difficulty destroying enemies.

The game itself was created with a 3D rendering library called THREE.js and a physics library called CANNON.js. I used Angular to create the front-end and wrapped the game in a directive. The Backend API was created with NODE, Postgrsql, and Express. It also an ORM called waterline for database setup and queries.
